The PowerLite PDO library is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/migliori/power-lite-pdo](https://github.com/migliori/power-lite-pdo) and is distributed under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

## Install with Composer

To install the PowerLite PDO library, you need to use Composer, the PHP dependency manager. If you haven't installed Composer yet, you can download it from [here](https://getcomposer.org/).

Once you have Composer installed, you can install the PowerLite PDO library by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
composer require migliori/power-lite-pdo
```

We recommend using Composer for installation as it handles dependencies and updates efficiently. However, if you prefer, you can also clone or download the library directly from Github.
